Today, I began setting up the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for my chatbot. RAG combines the power of knowledge retrieval with the generative capabilities of large language models, allowing the chatbot to fetch relevant information from external databases before generating responses. This is particularly useful for knowledge-based queries where the model alone might not have all the necessary context. I integrated a knowledge retrieval mechanism into the chatbot, enabling it to pull data from a predefined database. Setting up the RAG system involved configuring both the retrieval and generation pipelines, ensuring that the chatbot can seamlessly access and use relevant data during conversations. The RAG system significantly enhances the chatbot's ability to provide accurate, informative responses, especially when dealing with complex or specific user queries. Iâ€™m excited to see how this integration will improve the overall performance of the chatbot in future test
