API Integration with OpenAI and Gemini

Today, I focused on integrating two powerful APIs, OpenAI and Gemini, into my chatbot. These APIs allow the chatbot to generate high-quality responses based on the fine-tuned model. OpenAI's GPT API is well-known for its robust conversational capabilities, while the Gemini API brings additional benefits like handling more structured tasks. Setting up both APIs was a challenging yet rewarding process. I ensured the chatbot could send user inputs to the appropriate API and retrieve the corresponding response efficiently. However, I encountered some latency issues where response times were longer than expected, particularly with real-time conversations. I will need to look into optimizing the speed and efficiency of these API calls to improve the overall user experience. By the end of the day, the chatbot was functional with these APIs, providing insightful and coherent responses. This integration marks a significant step in the project, as it allows for more advanced conversational capabilities moving forward.
