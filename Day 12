Today was dedicated to training the chatbot using the fine-tuned large language model (LLM) from earlier in the process. The objective was to get the chatbot to learn how to engage in human-like conversations, answer user queries, and provide accurate responses based on context. I designed dialogue flows that guide the chatbot’s behavior and ensure that responses stay relevant to user inputs. Throughout the training process, I ran several test cases to evaluate the chatbot’s ability to handle a variety of scenarios, including simple questions, follow-up queries, and more complex dialogues. While the chatbot performed well in most cases, I noticed that certain responses could be more refined, particularly in multi-turn conversations. This step emphasized how essential proper training and data quality are in improving chatbot performance. I’ll continue refining the model and expanding its dataset to handle more nuanced conversations in the future.
