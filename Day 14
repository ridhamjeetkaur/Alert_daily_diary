Today, I integrated the retrieval component more deeply into the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This enhancement allows the chatbot to pull information from external databases before generating responses, which is especially useful for answering knowledge-based questions. I set up an indexing mechanism for the knowledge base, ensuring that the chatbot could quickly find and retrieve relevant information during a conversation. The retrieval system significantly improved the quality of the chatbot’s answers, especially for complex queries that require more detailed information than what the model alone could generate. However, I noticed that the retrieval process sometimes slowed down the response time, which I’ll need to address in the optimization phase. By the end of the day, the chatbot was able to handle knowledge-based queries much more effectively, marking a significant improvement in its overall conversational abilities.
