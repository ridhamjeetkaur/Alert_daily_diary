Today’s focus was on performance tuning, particularly optimizing the speed and accuracy of the RAG system. The goal was to reduce response time while maintaining the quality and relevance of the chatbot’s answers. I worked on optimizing both the retrieval and generation components, ensuring they work seamlessly together. This involved streamlining the process of fetching relevant data from the knowledge base and improving the way the chatbot generates responses based on the retrieved information. I experimented with various techniques such as caching frequently used data and fine-tuning the retrieval algorithms to reduce processing time. These optimizations significantly improved the chatbot’s response time, making interactions feel more natural and real-time. The performance tuning has enhanced the overall user experience, and I’m now confident that the chatbot can handle complex queries efficiently.
