Today, I focused on implementing error-handling mechanisms within the chatbot system. This is a crucial step for improving the overall user experience, ensuring the chatbot responds gracefully to unexpected inputs or technical issues. I designed the chatbot to recognize and respond to unrecognized inputs with fallback responses like, "I’m sorry, I didn’t understand that. Could you please rephrase your question?" This helps avoid user frustration when the chatbot cannot understand a query. Additionally, I added a system that alerts the chatbot when the retrieval component fails to find relevant data. In such cases, the chatbot will inform the user that it is still learning and cannot provide an answer at that moment. By the end of the day, I had a more robust system in place that could handle errors smoothly, minimizing user confusion and frustration. This implementation will be critical in making the chatbot more resilient to real-world usage, where errors and unexpected inputs are inevitable.
