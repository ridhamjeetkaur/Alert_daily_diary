Today’s focus was on enhancing the overall user experience (UX) of the chatbot. I revisited the conversational flow to ensure it felt as natural and human-like as possible. This included improving the phrasing of responses, adding more variation in the chatbot’s answers, and ensuring it could engage in small talk where necessary. I also added features like the ability to remember user preferences and maintain context throughout multi-turn conversations, making interactions smoother and more personalized. In addition to refining the dialogue system, I worked on improving the visual interface by adding tooltips, better button designs, and clearer indications of when the chatbot is thinking or retrieving information. These small but significant improvements are aimed at creating a seamless experience for the user, making interactions more intuitive and engaging. By the end of the day, I was pleased with the changes, as the chatbot felt more dynamic and responsive, ready to handle real-world conversations more effectively.
