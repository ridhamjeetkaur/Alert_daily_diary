Today, I tested the chatbot in a variety of scenarios to evaluate its adaptability and performance. This was a critical step to ensure that the chatbot could handle diverse user inputs, ranging from customer support queries to troubleshooting and general information requests. I simulated several real-life user interactions, including those with multiple follow-up questions, changing contexts, and ambiguous queries. The goal was to see how well the chatbot retained context and responded to different conversational styles. Overall, the chatbot performed well in straightforward scenarios but encountered some issues with complex multi-turn conversations. I noted several areas where improvements could be made, particularly in maintaining context and refining responses in long conversations. These insights will be useful for further tuning the dialogue flow and improving the chatbotâ€™s ability to adapt to more challenging user interactions.
