After noticing the challenges with multi-turn conversations during yesterday’s testing, I spent today addressing these issues. Multi-turn conversations require the chatbot to remember previous exchanges and provide coherent responses that follow the flow of the dialogue. I implemented a mechanism to store conversation history, enabling the chatbot to maintain context across multiple questions and answers. This allows the chatbot to reference earlier parts of the conversation, making the dialogue feel more fluid and natural. Additionally, I worked on improving the chatbot’s ability to disambiguate questions when users ask follow-up queries, ensuring that the answers provided are relevant and precise. While this significantly improved the chatbot’s performance, I still encountered some challenges with more complex conversations where users changed topics frequently. Nonetheless, today’s improvements have made the chatbot much more adept at handling longer conversations, which will be crucial in real-world applications.
