Today, I explored the fascinating world of natural language processing (NLP), a crucial area of AI that allows machines ofto understand, interpret, and generate human language.
I learned about various NLP tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition,
which are essential for converting raw text into structured data. The importance of these tasks became clear, 
as they form the backbone of chatbots and voice assistants. Additionally, I studied core NLP techniques like stemming, 
lemmatization, and stop-word removal, which help improve text analysis. My training today reinforced how NLP models 
learn patterns from vast amounts of data to enable human-like interactions in chatbots. This deep dive into NLP 
helped me understand the complexity of human language and the challenges of teaching machines to interpret nuances
like context, tone, and ambiguity. Going forward, Iâ€™ll apply this knowledge to building chatbots and exploring more
advanced techniques such as sentiment analysis and semantic understanding.
