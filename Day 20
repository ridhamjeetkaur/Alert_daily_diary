Today, I encountered significant challenges while training the chatbot to handle language-specific queries, particularly in languages like Punjabi. As the chatbot was originally trained in English, it struggled with understanding and responding to non-English queries accurately. I explored several techniques to address this, including translating user inputs to English before processing them through the chatbot and then translating the responses back to the original language. While this approach worked to some extent, it introduced delays and occasionally led to loss of meaning during translation. I also began researching multilingual datasets and models that are natively trained in multiple languages, including Punjabi, to improve the chatbot’s ability to handle such queries more efficiently. This experience highlighted the complexity of building a truly multilingual chatbot and the need for specialized models and datasets. Moving forward, I plan to dive deeper into multilingual training and fine-tuning methods to improve the chatbot’s performance in handling diverse languages.
