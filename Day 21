Today, I explored the integration of speech-to-text capabilities into the chatbot, a significant step toward creating a multimodal interaction experience. Using external APIs, I enabled the chatbot to transcribe spoken input into text. This feature will allow users to interact with the chatbot using their voice instead of typing. I began by integrating an API such as Google’s Speech-to-Text, which converts the user’s spoken words into text that the chatbot can process. There were some challenges, particularly with recognizing accents and handling noisy environments, but overall, the integration worked well. I also added a system that allows the chatbot to respond in text format or, alternatively, convert its responses back into speech using text-to-speech technology. This feature paves the way for voice-controlled chatbots, which can be incredibly useful for users with accessibility needs or those preferring hands-free interaction. I plan to refine this further, focusing on improving the speed and accuracy of the transcription.
