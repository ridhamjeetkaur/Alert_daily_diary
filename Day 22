Today was an exciting day as I conducted real-time testing of the chatbot with a group of users. This was the first time the chatbot interacted with real people beyond simulated scenarios. The feedback I received was invaluable. Most users appreciated the natural flow of the conversation and the chatbot’s ability to provide quick, accurate responses. However, there were also some areas for improvement. Some users experienced delays in response time, and a few struggled with the chatbot’s handling of more complex or ambiguous questions. Interestingly, the speech-to-text functionality received mixed reviews, with some users enjoying it and others finding it less efficient than typing. This feedback will help me refine the model to better meet user expectations. I’ve noted all the suggestions and will work on making the necessary adjustments, especially focusing on improving response time and handling more nuanced queries.
