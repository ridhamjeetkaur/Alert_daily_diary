After the feedback from yesterday’s user testing, I spent today focusing on optimizing the chatbot’s response time. One of the key complaints was that the chatbot took a little too long to respond in certain situations, especially when retrieving information using the RAG system. I started by analyzing the system’s performance, identifying bottlenecks in both the retrieval and generation processes. I optimized the API requests to make them faster and more efficient and also cached frequent queries to reduce the time it takes to retrieve common answers. Additionally, I looked into parallelizing some parts of the code to speed up processing. By the end of the day, I managed to reduce the response time significantly, improving the chatbot’s overall performance. I will continue to monitor its performance in real-world scenarios to ensure that the chatbot remains responsive and efficient, especially when deployed at scale.
