Today was dedicated to debugging various issues that surfaced during the testing phase. There were some inconsistencies in the chatbot’s responses, especially when dealing with retrieval-based queries. In certain cases, the bot would provide incomplete or mismatched answers due to problems with the retrieval mechanism or generation process. I started by going through the logs to identify the root causes of these issues. One significant bug was in the code handling multiple queries at once, which sometimes led to responses being cut off. I fixed this by reworking the logic that controls the query queue, ensuring that every request is processed in full before the next one begins. Additionally, I debugged a problem where some retrieved information wasn’t relevant to the query. I added additional filters to improve the relevance of the retrieved content. By the end of the day, most of these issues were resolved, and the chatbot performed more reliably.
