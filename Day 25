Today, I focused on refining the knowledge base that the RAG system uses for retrieval. The quality of the chatbot’s responses largely depends on the relevance and depth of the information in the knowledge base. I expanded the knowledge base by adding more domain-specific data to improve the chatbot’s responses to industry-specific queries. I also worked on organizing the data more efficiently, ensuring that the retrieval process could access it faster. Additionally, I included metadata tags to categorize the information, making it easier for the retrieval mechanism to find the most relevant data. I ran several tests to ensure the chatbot could quickly and accurately pull information from this updated knowledge base. The refinement process has significantly improved the depth and accuracy of the responses, especially for more complex queries that require detailed knowledge. This will enhance the chatbot’s ability to serve as a reliable information source.
