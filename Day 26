With the chatbot nearing completion, I spent today exploring future enhancements to make the system even more robust and feature-rich. One idea I’m excited about is expanding the chatbot’s multilingual capabilities, allowing it to handle conversations in multiple languages beyond English and Punjabi. This would require further fine-tuning and access to multilingual datasets. Another enhancement I considered is incorporating sentiment analysis, allowing the chatbot to detect the emotional tone of user messages and respond accordingly. This could make interactions feel more personalized and empathetic. I also looked into adding support for more advanced voice interaction, possibly integrating voice commands for specific actions. Additionally, I began thinking about ethical considerations, such as how to ensure the chatbot behaves responsibly, avoids biased responses, and maintains user privacy. These future enhancements will keep the chatbot relevant and adaptable as it continues to evolve alongside AI technology.
