Today, I spent time preparing the chatbot for its final evaluation. This involved running a series of stress tests, debugging any last-minute issues, and ensuring that all features worked seamlessly. I conducted more user tests to evaluate how well the chatbot handles real-world scenarios, paying particular attention to its performance in areas that had been challenging during earlier phases, such as multi-turn conversations and language-specific queries. I also documented the chatbotâ€™s development process, from initial design through implementation and testing, to ensure that the project was ready for review. I focused on making sure the chatbot was both functional and scalable, ready for deployment in a production environment. By the end of the day, the chatbot was in its final form, with optimized performance, a refined knowledge base, and enhanced conversational abilities.
