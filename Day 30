Today marks the end of my AI training, and I spent time reflecting on the entire journey. Over the past 28 days, I’ve gained in-depth knowledge about AI, LLMs, RAG systems, and chatbot development. I’m proud of the chatbot I’ve created, which is capable of handling a wide range of user queries, retrieving relevant information, and providing meaningful responses. The integration of speech-to-text and error handling has made the chatbot more versatile and user-friendly. Looking forward, I plan to continue improving the chatbot by incorporating some of the enhancements I explored, such as multilingual support and sentiment analysis. I also want to delve deeper into ethical AI, ensuring that the chatbot is safe, responsible, and free from bias. Overall, this training has been an enriching experience, and I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned to future AI projects
