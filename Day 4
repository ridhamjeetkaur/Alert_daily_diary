Introduction to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Today, I was introduced to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a system that combines large language models with retrieval 
mechanisms. This innovative approach allows a chatbot to fetch relevant knowledge from an external database before 
generating a response, improving the quality and accuracy of its answers. I learned how RAG bridges the gap between pure 
generation models and information retrieval, making it ideal for applications that require up-to-date or domain-specific
knowledge. For instance, customer support chatbots using RAG can pull data from a knowledge base or company documents to
provide accurate answers. Understanding how RAG works was enlightening, and it opened my eyes to the potential of 
combining retrieval with generation for more effective AI solutions. This knowledge will be instrumental as I continue 
to build and refine my chatbot, ensuring it can access relevant data while generating contextually appropriate 
responses
