Setting Up My Development Environment

Today was all about setting up my development environment to begin working on AI models and chatbots. I installed Python,
Jupyter Notebooks, and several key libraries like Hugging Face Transformers, which are essential for working with LLMs. 
Additionally, I explored APIs such as OpenAI's GPT and Gemini, which provide access to powerful language models that
can integrate into my chatbot project. This setup process was crucial to ensuring that I have all the necessary tools to 
train and fine-tune AI models, as well as integrate them into web applications. While it was a more technical day, it 
laid the groundwork for hands-on work in the coming days. Having everything properly configured means I can now 
focus entirely on developing, fine-tuning, and deploying the chatbot without being slowed down by technical issues.
