Today was focused on gathering and preparing data for training my chatbot. I explored different sources to collect large text datasets, as high-quality data is critical for effective model training. I researched publicly available datasets, ranging from customer support dialogues to general conversation datasets, ensuring I have a rich variety of content to train the chatbot on. I also learned the importance of diverse data that represents different conversational tones, dialects, and languages. Understanding the nuances of data collection gave me insights into how the quality of training data directly affects model performance. By the end of the day, I had compiled a solid set of text data, which I plan to preprocess and clean in the coming days. This process reinforced how critical the early stages of data preparation are to the entire machine learning pipeline.
