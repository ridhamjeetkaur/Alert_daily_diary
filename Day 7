Today, I focused on preprocessing the collected data. Preprocessing is a crucial step in ensuring that the input data is clean, structured, and ready for model training. I began by removing unnecessary elements like stop words, punctuation, and special characters, which do not add value to the chatbotâ€™s responses. Additionally, I tokenized the text and performed stemming and lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms, making the data more consistent and easier for the model to understand. I also dealt with outliers and removed irrelevant data points that could skew the chatbot's learning process. By the end of the day, I had a clean, well-prepared dataset. This work will improve the performance and accuracy of the model, ensuring the chatbot can process and generate coherent, contextually appropriate responses.
