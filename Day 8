Today was an exciting day as I delved into fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) for my chatbot. Using Hugging Face’s transformers library, I fine-tuned a pre-trained model with my own dataset. Fine-tuning allows the model to adjust to the specific domain or tasks I’m working on, such as generating responses for a chatbot. I experimented with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, to optimize the training process. While the initial results were promising, I realized that fine-tuning is an iterative process that requires a lot of testing and evaluation to get right. By the end of the day, I had a model that was better suited for conversational AI, and I’m eager to continue improving it. This experience reinforced the importance of fine-tuning in making a generic model perform well in a specialized application.
