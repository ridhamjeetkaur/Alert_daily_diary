Today, I dedicated my time to understanding the architecture of transformer models in greater depth. The transformer model is a foundational component of large language models like GPT, and itâ€™s known for its ability to handle long-range dependencies in text through its attention mechanism. I studied how self-attention works to allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, making it highly efficient for NLP tasks. I also explored how transformers can process text in parallel, unlike RNNs, which handle data sequentially. This deep dive helped me understand why transformers are so powerful and how they form the backbone of state-of-the-art models like GPT and BERT. This understanding is crucial as I continue to build my chatbot, which relies heavily on these transformer models for generating accurate and contextually appropriate responses.
