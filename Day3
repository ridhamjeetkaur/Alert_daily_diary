Large Language Models (LLMs) Overview

Todayâ€™s focus was on Large Language Models (LLMs), which are crucial for generating human-like text.
I  learned about the architecture of LLMs, particularly transformer models, which are designed to process
sequential data efficiently using self-attention mechanisms. This innovative architecture allows LLMs 
to excel in tasks like translation, summarization, and dialogue generation. I explored models like GPT (
Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), 
understanding their strengths and how they are fine-tuned for specific tasks. What stood out today was 
the sheer scale of these models, which are trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate coherent, 
context-aware responses. I realized the significance of LLMs in chatbot development, where they are used to 
generate natural-sounding, informative answers. This session broadened my understanding of the AI landscape and 
made me excited to start working with these powerful models in practical applications.
